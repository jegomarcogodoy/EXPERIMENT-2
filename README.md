EXPERIMENT-2 | JEGO MARCO E. GODOY | 2ECE-A
****************** Experiment Overview 🔍 ******************
Experiment 2 focuses on using the NumPy Library. The purpose of this experiment is to use the NumPy Library to create a Python program by identifying and applying various codes and functions.

This experiment comprises 2 problems, namely:
(1) NORMALIZATION PROBLEM - where a 5x5 ndarray with random elements is stored in the variable X, and this ndarray is normalized.

(2) DIVISIBLE BY 3 PROBLEM - where the SQUARES of the first 100 positive integers are the elements of a 10x10 ndarray, and from this ndarray, all elements divisible by 3 are saved.

********************* Coding Process ✏️ *********************
-- > The "np.random.random((x,y))" function is used and stored to variable x to generate the 5x5 random element ndarray.

-- > Once the ndarray is generated and stored in "x", the next step is to get the MEAN and STANDARD DEVIATION of the ndarray. That can be done by using the "x.mean()" and "x.std()" functions, which are then stored in y and z, respectively.

-- > The final step is to normalize the ndarray by using the formula = x - Mean / Standard Deviation. Coding-wise, that will be [(x-y)/z] and that will be stored as "normx".


For Problem 2: Divisible by 3 Problem,

-- > The first step was to create the 10x10 ndarray with elements as the squares of the first 100 positive integers.


--> Next, elements inside the ndarray are then determined whether they are divisible by 3 or not. Those divisible by 3 are then saved into another ndarray.

********************* Conclusion 🤓 *********************
After conducting this experiment, I learned to:

(a.) to recognize and utilize various codes and functions

(b.) to be able to apply and utilize the many codes and functions while utilizing the Numpy library to create a Python program.
