EXPERIMENT-2 | JEGO MARCO E. GODOY | 2ECE-A

****************** Experiment Overview 🔍 ******************
________________________________________________________________
Experiment 2 focuses on using the NumPy Library. The purpose of this experiment is to use the NumPy Library to create a Python program by identifying and applying various codes and functions.

This experiment comprises 2 problems, namely:
(1) NORMALIZATION PROBLEM - where a 5x5 ndarray with random elements is stored in the variable X, and this ndarray is normalized.

(2) DIVISIBLE BY 3 PROBLEM - where the SQUARES of the first 100 positive integers are the elements of a 10x10 ndarray, and from this ndarray, all elements divisible by 3 are saved.

********************* Coding Process ✏️ *********************
__________________________________________________________________
-- > The 5x5 random element ndarray is created using the "np.random.random((x,y))" function and placed in variable x.

-- > The next step is to determine the ndarray's MEAN and STANDARD DEVIATION after it has been formed and saved in "x". The "x.mean()" and "x.std()" functions can be used for that, and the results are saved in y and z, respectively.

-- > The last step is to use the formula = x - Mean / Standard Deviation to normalize the ndarray. [(x-y)/z] is the coding for that, and "normx" will be the storage value.


For Problem 2: Divisible by 3 Problem,

-- > The first step was to create the 10x10 ndarray with elements as the squares of the first 100 positive integers.


--> Next, elements inside the ndarray are then determined whether they are divisible by 3 or not. Those divisible by 3 are then saved into another ndarray.


********************* Conclusion 🤓 *********************
______________________________________________________________
After conducting this experiment, I learned to:

(a.) to recognize and utilize various codes and functions

(b.) to be able to apply and utilize the many codes and functions while utilizing the Numpy library to create a Python program.
